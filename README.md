The provided Python code conducts a comprehensive customer segmentation analysis using the K-means clustering algorithm. In the initial stages, essential libraries, such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for visualization, and Scikit-learn's KMeans for clustering, are imported. The dataset is  stored in a CSV file named 'Mall_Customers.csv,' is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame named 'df.'

A brief exploration of the dataset follows, where the first few rows are displayed to provide an overview of its structure. Additionally, information about missing values and data types is printed using the 'df.info()' function. Descriptive statistics of numerical columns are presented through 'df.describe()' to offer insights into the central tendencies and distributions of the data.

To gain visual insights into customer behavior, two key visualizations are created. The first is a scatter plot depicting the relationship between 'Annual Income' and 'Spending Score,' providing an initial understanding of potential clusters within the data. The second visualization takes the form of a histogram, illustrating the distribution of customer ages in the dataset.

The core of the analysis involves customer segmentation using the K-means clustering algorithm. The relevant features for clustering, 'Annual Income' and 'Spending Score,' are selected and standardized using Scikit-learn's StandardScaler. The Elbow method is employed to identify the optimal number of clusters, with the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) computed for cluster numbers ranging from 1 to 10. The resulting Elbow method curve aids in visually determining the suitable number of clusters.

Following the determination of the optimal cluster count (set at 3 in this case), K-means clustering is executed. The resulting cluster labels are assigned to the DataFrame, and a final visualization showcases the segmented clusters. The scatter plot of 'Annual Income' vs. 'Spending Score' distinguishes clusters using different colors, providing a clear representation of how customers are grouped based on their spending behavior.

In conclusion, this analysis allows for a nuanced understanding of customer segmentation, enabling businesses to tailor strategies and services to different customer segments based on their spending patterns and annual income. The integration of visualizations and clustering techniques provides valuable insights that can inform targeted marketing efforts and enhance overall customer satisfaction.
